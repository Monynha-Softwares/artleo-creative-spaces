# Audit of Fixes

## Liquid Ether Background Integration
- **Files:** `src/App.tsx`, `src/layouts/PublicLayout.tsx`, `src/components/reactbits/LiquidEtherBackground.tsx`, `src/components/reactbits/LiquidEther.tsx`, `src/pages/Home.tsx`, `README.md`.
- **Issues Resolved:**
  - Ensured the Liquid Ether background is initialised once in a shared public layout and available on all public routes, eliminating route-specific gaps.
  - Removed the obsolete `SilkBackground` component to avoid confusion and unused WebGL bundles.
  - Corrected pointer-event handling by listening to window-level pointer events, keeping interactions responsive even with layered content.
  - Added WebGL capability detection with a graceful gradient fallback for users with `prefers-reduced-motion` or missing WebGL support.
- **Performance Notes:**
  - Introduced route-level lazy loading via `React.lazy` to decrease the initial bundle for non-critical pages.
  - Updated React Query cache defaults (5-minute stale time, focus/reconnect refetch disabled) to prevent redundant Supabase calls.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Main content now sits inside a focusable `<main id="main-content">` to support skip navigation tooling.

## Supabase Hook Consolidation
- **Files:** `src/hooks/useArtworks.ts`, `src/hooks/useArtwork.ts`, `src/hooks/useExhibitions.ts`, `src/hooks/usePages.ts`, `src/hooks/useSettings.ts`.
- **Issues Resolved:**
  - Centralised table reads through typed hooks with consistent error handling and published-status filtering to comply with RLS policies.
  - Added dedicated hooks for `pages` and `settings` to avoid ad-hoc queries and support future data-driven layouts.
- **Performance Notes:**
  - Shared query keys allow React Query to cache records across views, reducing duplicate Supabase round trips.
- **RLS Observations:**
  - Public fetches explicitly enforce `status = 'published'` for artworks/pages, respecting row-level policies. Draft access remains opt-in via the new `includeDrafts` flag for authenticated contexts.

## Contact Form Reliability & Accessibility
- **Files:** `src/hooks/useContactForm.ts`, `src/pages/Contact.tsx`.
- **Issues Resolved:**
  - Migrated the contact form to React Hook Form with Zod validation, surfacing inline error messages and improving submission reliability.
  - Hardened Supabase mutations with user-friendly error messaging and consistent promise resolution to support `mutateAsync` flows.
- **Accessibility:**
  - Added explicit labels, `aria-invalid`/`aria-describedby`, and heading references so assistive tech reports validation feedback correctly.

## Visual & Media Tweaks
- **Files:** `src/pages/About.tsx`.
- **Changes:** Added `loading="lazy"` to non-critical imagery to defer network cost and improve LCP on slower connections.

## Environment & Secrets
- The application continues to rely on `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` without logging their values. No runtime logs expose credential material.

## Remaining Considerations
- Vite reports a large vendor chunk (`index-CxWAJyF1.js`) due to heavy WebGL/animation dependencies. Additional manual chunking or conditional loading of 3D modules can further decrease the initial payload below the 170 kB target in a subsequent optimisation pass.
